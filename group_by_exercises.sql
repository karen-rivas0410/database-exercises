SELECT DISTINCT titles from titles;


# Find your query for employees whose last names start and end with 'E'. Update the query find just the unique last names
# that start and end with 'E' using GROUP BY. The results should be:

select last_name from employees
where last_name like 'e%e'
group by last_name;


# Update your previous query to now find unique combinations of first and last name where the last name starts and ends with 'E'. You should get 846 rows.

# Find the unique last names with a 'q' but not 'qu'. Your results should be:

select last_name from employees
where last_name like '%q%'
group by last_name;

# Add a COUNT() to your results and use ORDER BY to make it easier to find employees whose unusual name is shared with others.

# Update your query for 'Irena', 'Vidya', or 'Maya'. Use count(*) and GROUP BY to find the number of employees for
# each gender with those names. Your results should be:

select gender, count(*) from employees
